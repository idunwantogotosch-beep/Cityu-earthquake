# CityU BOC Earthquake Survival — Static Website

This folder contains a static website that loads a 3D OBJ model and lets users place and test eight locations for an earthquake demo.

Quick local preview

```bash
cd "/Users/kyliekan/Desktop/~:Desktop:CityU-Earthquake"
# start a simple static server
python3 -m http.server 8000
open http://localhost:8000
```

Make the site public (recommended: GitHub Pages)

1. Create a GitHub repository and push this folder as the repository root.
2. Add the following GitHub Action (already included in this repo) that deploys to the `gh-pages` branch on every push.
3. Push to `main` (or whichever branch you use). The Action will publish to `gh-pages`.
4. In GitHub: Settings → Pages, select branch `gh-pages` and root `/` as the source. Your site will be available at `https://<your-user>.github.io/<repo>`.

Other hosting options

- Netlify: drag & drop the site folder or connect your GitHub repo. No build step required.
- Vercel: import the repo and deploy (select "Static Site").

Notes

- The site loads `three.js` and example loaders from CDN, so it doesn’t require npm.
- The project references assets with relative paths; keep the asset files next to `index.html`.
- If the OBJ/MTL/textures do not appear after deployment, open the browser DevTools Console/Network to inspect errors.

If you want, I can (choose one):
- create a zip of the website ready for upload,
- convert the OBJ into a GLB for better performance,
- push this folder to a new GitHub repository for you (you must provide repository access).
